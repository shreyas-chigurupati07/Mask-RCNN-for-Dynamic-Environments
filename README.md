# Mask R-CNN for Pose Estimation in Dynamic Environments

## Overview

This project enhances the Mask R-CNN framework with ResNet50 for human pose estimation, focusing on dynamic environments. The Real-time Pose Correction Feedback System is designed to assist users in maintaining proper form during physical exercises, starting with yoga, by providing real-time visual feedback.

## Key Features

- Utilizes Mask R-CNN with ResNet50 for accurate human pose estimation.
- Offers real-time feedback by comparing user's posture against ideal exercise forms.
- Targets yoga for initial analysis but is adaptable to various sports for posture improvement.

## Dataset

The project employs a subset of a larger yoga dataset, comprising 500 annotated images to ensure a diverse range of poses for comprehensive learning and analysis.

## Proposed Method

- **Model Architecture**: Integrates ResNet50 with Mask R-CNN for feature extraction and pose estimation.
- **Keypoint Detection**: Incorporates a dense layer in the network to predict x and y coordinates of key human joints.
- **Feedback System**: Analyzes captured poses against ideal ones to provide corrective feedback in real-time.
- **Training and Optimization**: Employs data augmentation, dropout, and fine-tuning strategies to enhance model performance and prevent overfitting.

## Results and Discussion

- The model demonstrates a stable training performance with notable accuracy in pose estimation.
- Real-world application potential in fitness, health monitoring, and sports training.
